# Stuff for new Auton Idea #
Surya is trying to experiment an autonomous idea and needs your help.
* Requirements: Know how to convert f(t) to x(t) and y(t), Know how to calculate arc length of an equation given time.

## Graph 1 and 2 ##
Click here to view the [1st graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lvpkemrfcv), and click here to view the [2nd graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/46w0wou5za).

How can you help?
* Find x(t) and y(t) given the piecewise function of f(t) 
  * The starting point is when y = 0 (t = 0 during that mark), the point where the black line intersects the graph should represent the t = 1.2 mark, and the end point is where y is at its max (t should be = 2). The t numbers are just approximations, if you come up with functions that are slightly off, thatâ€™s completely fine.
  * The function f(t) will be piecewise as well (or at least I think).
* Find an equation where I will be able to plug in time, and it outputs the arclength of the function
  * It's fine if its piecewise.

## Graph 3 and 4 ##

How can you help?
* Find x(t) and y(t) given the piecewise function of f(t)
  * The starting point is when y = 0 (t = 0 during that mark), the first intersection between the curve and the black line represents the t = .8 mark, the second intersection between the curve and the black line represents the t = 2 mark, and the end point is when the y is at its max (t = 2.6 mark).
  * The function f(t) will be piecewise as well (or at least I think).
* Find an equation where I will be able to plug in time, and it outputs the arclength of the function
  * It's fine if its piecewise.
