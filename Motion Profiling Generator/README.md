To set the field image go to settings and select the field image as the background.

If the buttons and such do not work, take a look at this: https://github.com/vannaka/Motion_Profile_Generator/issues/38 , They helped me fix the issue.
You can try to build the developer if the 3.0.0 release does not work, but you will need to install homebrew (if on mac) or scoop (if on windows) and use it to install gradle. (look up how to do this)

Currently the application also does not work on Surya's Mac (points don't show up)
