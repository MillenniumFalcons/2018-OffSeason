# Programming a wrist #

## Introduction ##
Programming a wrist is very similar to programming an elevator. The primary differences are that the elevator has 5 different levels, whereas the wrist only had 3. Other notable differences are that the elevator is controlled by 2 SPX's and 2 SRX's, while the wrist is controlled by one SRX. The wrist also has a limit switch, that tell you wheater the wrist is flat or not (very similar to how the banner sensor tells you if the elevator is all the way down or not).

To write the wrist program, we will be working with both the [Robot.java](https://github.com/MillenniumFalcons/2018-PowerUp/blob/master/Robot_Code/src/org/usfirst/frc/team3647/robot/Robot.java) file, and the [Wrist.java](https://github.com/MillenniumFalcons/2018-PowerUp/blob/master/Robot_Code/src/team3647elevator/Wrist.java) file. You can also feel free to look at the [Elevator.java](https://github.com/MillenniumFalcons/2018-PowerUp/blob/master/Robot_Code/src/team3647elevator/Elevator.java) file for assitance.
