# Programming a wrist #

## Introduction ##
Programming a wrist is very similar to programming an elevator. The primary differences are that the elevator has 5 different levels, whereas the wrist only had 3. Other notable differences are that the elevator is controlled by 2 SPX's and 2 SRX's, while the wrist is controlled by one SRX. The wrist also has a limit switch, that tell you wheater the wrist is flat or not (very similar to how the banner sensor tells you if the elevator is all the way down or not).

To write the wrist program, we will be working with both the [Robot.java](https://github.com/MillenniumFalcons/2018-PowerUp/blob/master/Robot_Code/src/org/usfirst/frc/team3647/robot/Robot.java) file, and the [Wrist.java](https://github.com/MillenniumFalcons/2018-PowerUp/blob/master/Robot_Code/src/team3647elevator/Wrist.java) file. You can also feel free to look at the [Elevator.java](https://github.com/MillenniumFalcons/2018-PowerUp/blob/master/Robot_Code/src/team3647elevator/Elevator.java) file for assitance.

## Step 1: Make sure the wrist motor works ##
1. First create a static ```WPI_TalonSRX``` motor called ```wristMotor```.
2. Create a static function called ```moveWrist()``` that takes in the parameter ```speed```. In this function you will set the speed of the ```wristMotor``` to the ```speed``` variable. ```wristMotor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, speed);```
3. Create a function called ```stopWrist``` that sets the speed of the ```wristMotor``` to 0.
4. _For testing purposes go to the ```runElevator()``` function and add ```Wrist.moveWrist(joy.leftJoySticky1);``` after ```eleVader.setElevatorEncoder();```. To test if this works you would have to move the right joystick on the co-driver controller._
5. Make sure that the wrist moves up when you send it a positive value to the ```moveWrist()``` function that the wrist rotates upward, and that the wrist moves downward if you send a negative value to the ```moveWrist()``` function. If it is flipped, change ```wristMotor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, -speed);``` to ```wristMotor.set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, speed);```

For steps 1 - 3 use the [Wrist.java](https://github.com/MillenniumFalcons/2018-PowerUp/blob/master/Robot_Code/src/team3647elevator/Wrist.java) file, and for step 4 use the [Robot.java](https://github.com/MillenniumFalcons/2018-PowerUp/blob/master/Robot_Code/src/org/usfirst/frc/team3647/robot/Robot.java) file.

## Step 2: Adjust the speed of the wrist ##
Since I am out of town, set the wrist to a constant speed for now. Try to pick a speed value that is not too fast, not too slow. So for example if you set ```.2``` as your speed, make the wrist move at ```.2``` whenever the joystick value is greater than ```0```,  and make the wrist move at ```-.2``` when the joystick value is less than ```0```. You guys are smart enough to figure this out.


## Step 3: Program the limit switch and the encoders ##
1. The limit switch works the same way the banner sensor does. Remember that the purpose of the limit switch is to that tell us wheater the wrist is flat or not. If it is flat, it must return ```true```, otherwise ```false```. Name the limit switch object ```limitSwitch``` (it's a ```DigitalInput```. If you have trouble, reference to [ElevatorLevel.java](https://github.com/MillenniumFalcons/2018-PowerUp/blob/master/Robot_Code/src/team3647elevator/ElevatorLevel.java) to see how the banner sensor was programmed).
2. Create a static ```testLimitSwitch()``` and ```setLimitSwitch()``` function to see if the limit switch works. Remember to use ```limitSwitch.get()``` to recieve the boolean variable. Make sure it returns ```true``` when the wrist is flat, and ```false``` otherwise. If it is flipped, change the ```flat``` variable statement to ```flat = !limitSwitch.get();``` instead of ```flat = limitSwitch.get();``` in the ```setLimitSwitch()``` function. _Test the limit switch_
3. For getting the encoder values use ```wristMotor.getSensorCollection().getQuadraturePosition();```. _Test if the encoder works_. Make the following functions like we always do: ```setEncoderValues()```, ```resetEncoders()```, ```testEncoders()```. Make sure to call the ```setEncoderValues()``` function in [Robot.java](https://github.com/MillenniumFalcons/2018-PowerUp/blob/master/Robot_Code/src/org/usfirst/frc/team3647/robot/Robot.java) from the ```Wrist``` class right after ```eleVader.setElevatorEncoder();``` in the ```runElevator()``` function.
4. Call the ```resetEncoders()``` function whenever the wrist is flat (when the ```flat``` variable is ```true```). For reseting the encoders, ```wristMotor.getSensorCollection().setQuadraturePosition(0, 10);```

## Step 4: Record the encoder values for each position ##
Very similar to how each elevator position had its own encoder position, the same thing applies for the wrist. Be sure to 0 the encoders when its flat before you measure the tick count. You can view the tick count by just printing the encoder value from the ```wristMotor```.
